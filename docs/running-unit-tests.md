# Technical Overview

To ensure that all checks are working correctly, the team is maintaining a set of unit tests. The tests setup is based on [wp-env](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/03/wp-env-simple-local-environments-for-wordpress/), so you could run a clean installation to run all tests.

Follow these instructions to configure and run tests:

1. You would need npm installed in your computer.
2. Ensure that you have installed all npm dependencies with `npm ci`.
3. You need to have Docker installed and running wp-env environment `npm run wp-env start`.
4. Run tests with npm command `npm run test-php`.

The full test suite is run against PRs as a GitHub action ([example](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check/actions/runs/9660204610)) so tests can be run against all supported environments. Passing tests is a requirement for merging PRs. Being able to run them locally is meant to help developers while working on or debugging tests, prior to submitting their code for review.

## Tests folder location

We have this structure for the tests folder:

- `tests/phpunit` Unit tests for the plugin.
  - `tests/phpunit/tests/` All PHPUnit tests that run as part of the suite.  
  - `tests/phpunit/testdata/` Example classes or plugins that can be used in tests.  
  - `tests/phpunit/utils/` Shared helpers that can be used across different test classes.  

Ensure that you create your check and unit test at same time.
